# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition

Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition! This repository contains code and resources for participating in the competition.

## Overview

The goal of this competition is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the collision of the Spaceship Titanic. You will be provided with a dataset containing information about the passengers and their journey on the spaceship.

## Getting Started

To get started with the competition, follow these steps:

1. **Download the dataset**: You can download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).
2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository.
3. **Run the notebook**: Use the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and build your models.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
